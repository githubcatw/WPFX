This library hasn't been maintained in a while and only adds a single toggle switch that doesn't look consistent with the Windows UI. I myself don't use WPF anymore and I think Microsoft will replace it with WinUI 3 anyway.

If you wish to fork this repository and add more controls feel free. This code is licensed under the MIT license.
